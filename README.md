# teddit


[teddit.net](https://teddit.net)


A free and open source alternative Reddit front-end focused on privacy.
Inspired by the [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) project.

* No JavaScript or ads
* All requests go through the backend, client never talks to Reddit
* Prevents Reddit from tracking your IP or JavaScript fingerprint
* Lightweight (teddit frontpage: ~30 HTTP requests with ~270 KB of data downloaded vs. Reddit frontpage: ~190 requests with ~24 MB)

For example:\

1. Install [redis-server](https://redis.io/) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)\
For example:\

Leave ffmpeg out if you don't want video support.
1. `$ git clone https://codeberg.org/teddit/teddit`
1. `$ cd teddit`
